# Development

#### Without Firebase hosting
 
<a href="https://github.com/The-Neon-Dev/ytdl/releases/tag/index"> Download index.html file in releases</a> and host where you want

#### With Firebase Hosting

Open the folder where you want to setup in vscode
```
git clone https://github.com/The-Neon-Dev/ytdl.git
```
Create project in Firebase and add SDK in index.html

Last, do firebase login,init, and deploy(look firebase instructions for web hosting)

Thats all,
I will make the Readme more easy to understand form in the future.
